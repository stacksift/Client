# Stacksift Client App

A Stacksift client for macOS.

This is quick-and-dirty [Stacksift](https://www.stacksift.io) client. It provides minimal filtering of reports, along with a way to navigate the graph of crash relationships that Stacksift maintains. It requires macOS 11.0 or later.

## Installation

A pre-built release binary is on its way! For now, you'll need to build from source.
